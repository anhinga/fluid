The Jun 4 2016 experiment is a light variation of Aug 24 2015 experiment
which introduces multiplicative masks, and which also introduces
neurons implementing trigonometric transforms for a rather spectacular
series of self-organizing visual effects...

Aug 24 2015 is a variation of aug_20_experiment

Stop/resume control changes:
  1) Press/release mouse button to stop/resume
  2) Press "Space" key to stop 
  3) Press/release mouse button to resume, if stopped

Brightness normalization changes
  1) Strech the range two-fold (correct for the default experiment,
     but needs to be done better for the general case)
  2) Multiply by stabilizing_adjustment in the randomized propagator 
    (1.004 is the value for the probability value 0.995)

The matrix element naming schema changed to conform to
the preprint schema in preparation for properly higher-order
matrix elements. A global dictionary of matrix elements
is introduced in preparation for properly higher-order
matrix elements, and this is what's used at the moment
for the first-and-half order programming schema currently in place.

*****
The first use of properly higher-order elements is added.
The implemention schema is currently somewhat clumsy,
possibly subject to revision.

This is very much work in progress (it does work for the
default experiment).
