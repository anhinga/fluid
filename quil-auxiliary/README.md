The follow-up to "fluid" project implements dataflow matrix machines
based on the space of V-values (see https://github.com/jsa-aerial/DMM
and Section 3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00648 )

This is a very neat implementation, but we have lost the nice
rendering capacities we were using in "fluid", which was all
done in Processing.

This directory is for experiments with Quil, a Clojure wrapper
for Processing.
