The follow-up to project Fluid implements dataflow matrix machines in Clojure
based on the space of V-values.

See https://github.com/jsa-aerial/DMM for the follow-up project itself
and Section 3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00648 for theory.

This is a very neat implementation, but we have lost the nice
rendering capacities we were using in Project Fluid, which is all
done in Processing.

This directory is for experiments with Quil, a Clojure wrapper
for Processing, with the goal to eventually add rendering
capabilities to our DMM implementation.
