This is a variation of aug_20_experiment

Stop/resume control changes:
  1) Press/release mouse button to stop/resume
  2) Press "Space" key to stop 
  3) Press/release mouse button to resume, if stopped

Brightness normalization changes
  1) Strech the range two-fold (correct for the default experiment,
     but needs to be done better for the general case)
  2) *1.004 in the randomized propagator (reasonable for the
     probability value 0.995, but needs to be done better
     for the general case)

The matrix element naming schema changed to conform to
the preprint schema in preparation for properly higher-order
matrix elements. A global dictionary of matrix elements
is introduced in preparation for properly higher-order
matrix elements, and this is what's used at the moment
for the first-and-half order programming schema currently in place.


This is very much work in progress (it does work for the
default experiment).
