Evolutionary experiments with the architecture which we started to work with here in June 2018:

afterlife_conway_2_mutate_2 - by pressing 0 to 4 the user can select the best of 5 networks
currently working in parallel, and continue to work with that network and its 4 clones changed with Gaussian noise.

(this is just some instrumentation; more needs to be done before one can hope for CPPN-like results here.

this serves as an inspiration for us here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network

but this directory is just a beginning of an attempt to do something similar in the DMM context).
