Note for Processing 3 users
===========================

Processing 3 requires to define "size" in "setup" with constant parameters.


The June 2015 experiments should run as is under Processing 3 
(tested for jun_28_15_experiment),
but May 2015 and August 2015 would need a patch.

The following minimal patch is tested using Processing 3.0.2
under Windows 7 for aug_24_15_experiment and
may_9_15_experiment. For a more civilized way to patch this
see the corresponding section of
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0

### aug_24:

this change in the setup() function in the main file of the sketch,
aug_24_15_experiment.pde:

`//size(board_size*square_size, board_size*square_size);
size(640, 640);`

### may_9:

comment out call to size() in the file may_8_graph.pde:

`//size (third_size + slider_width + margin_size, third_size);`

and instead insert size() with constant parameters into
the setup() function in the main file, may_9_15_experiment.pde:

`void setup () {
  current_run = new MasterConfig();
  may_8_graph(current_run);
  size(965, 915);
}`
