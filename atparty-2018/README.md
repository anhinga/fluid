Materials of my June 9, 2018 compo entries for @party will be added on June 10.

* game of afterlife

* surreal webcam

There will be documentation on how to use them, their architecture, and history of their creation.

"Game of Afterlife" is a self-referential self-modifying generalized neural network which processes streams of matrixes (we call those networks "pure lightweight dataflow matrix machines"), with added activation function inspired by Conway's game of life, with random initialization of the initial state (a random seed we liked was cached for reproducibility), and with some ad-hoc hacks, which modify the network at the selected points of time and add sonification based on 40Hz motives with overtones. We are going to release the silent version as well.

"Surreal webcam" is obtained by connecting a web camera to our earlier pipeline transforming image streams ("may_9_15_experiment" directory on the top level of this repository), enabling interesting interactive performances, so this is being entered as a freestyle interative compo.

The release is delayed till June 10 in order to comply with the @party compo rules.
