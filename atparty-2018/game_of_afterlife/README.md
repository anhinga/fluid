Code progression towards game_of_aterlife @party demo has been uploaded here, documentation is in progress...

The last of those demos contains audio and requires the install of Beads library for Processing 2.2.1: http://www.beadsproject.net/

The code evolved from https://github.com/anhinga/fluid/tree/master/Lightweight_Pure_DMMs (`aug_27_16_experiment`), described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00831

That code is the first example of a self-modifying dataflow matrix machine (a more expressive version of neural network).

The engine in all these cases is a small handcrafted recurrent neural network processing streams of matrixes instead of streams of numbers.

The master matrix containing the network weights is the top left rectangle.

The master row is the second row of the master matrix. The network weights in the master row are used to update the master matrix (including the master row itself).

In September 2016, 'nekel' changed initialization of the output layer to random and added normalization. This resulted in runs occasionally producing unexpected non-trivial dynamics. In June 2018, 'anhinga' instrumented random initialization using explicit randomly drawn seeds, so that the discovered non-trivial dynamics can be reproduced. The resulting code with one of the interesting seeds is `afterlife_9_1_seed`.

Then a `pseudoconway` activation function inspired by (but different from) the function describing one time step of Conway's game of life was added, and became one of the available activation functions for the neurons of our networks. The resuling code with one of the interesting seeds is `afterlife_conway_1_seed`.
