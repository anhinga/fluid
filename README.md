An experiment in using data flow programs to create animations.
===============================================================

This experiment is done in Processing;
tested for Processing 2.2.1
under Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.8.5

The two example data flow graphs are contained in the source files
"may_8_graph.pde" and "may_9_graph.pde". By default the first graph is
used, it is a directed acyclic graph (does not contain loops). 

To switch to the other one (which does contain a loop)
change what is commented out in the source file "may_9_15_experiment.pde".

This is one of the experiments for the line of research described
in the following preprint on linear models of computation: 
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu//~bukatin/LinearModelsProgramLearning.pdf
(currently this is the last link at 
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu//~bukatin/partial_inconsistency.html )

Any questions or comments, feel free to e-mail to the first author
of that preprint.
